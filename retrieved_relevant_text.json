Jared Golden \u2013 who holds a seat in an expansive, mostly rural district with a Cook PVI of Republican+6 \u2013 said he is not concerned with Biden's popularity because he is personally eclipsing the president by 30 points in his region.\n\nGolden was also the only House Democrat to join Republicans and vote against Biden's socioeconomic overhaul package dubbed \"Build Back Better.\" In 2018, he voted against Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in her bid to remain Speaker of the House, instead casting a vote for Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth.\n\n\"Things [are] getting pretty lonely for President Biden in his own party. Democrats are worried Biden scary poll numbers will lead to a midterm bloodbath and some are making sure to distance themselves from the commander-in-chief,\" host Dana Perino said. Perino added that people in \"vulnerable\" districts like Golden's are distancing themselves from the president.\n\nShe also pointed out that left-wing elected prosecutors in Democratic-run cities nationwide continue to propagate soft-on-crime policies.\n\n\"We saw \u2026 with \u2018Uncle Larry\u2019 Krasner in Philadelphia spending his whole press conference saying \u2018we don\u2019t have a problem, there is nothing happening here, you don\u2019t believe your own eyes, the crime is not up,'\" she said, alluding to recent remarks by the Philadelphia district attorney amid what is the highest murder rate in Pennsylvania's largest city since 1990.\n\nPhiladelphia recently surpassed 500 homicides this year under the watch of Krasner and fellow Democrat Mayor James Kenney. Last week, Kenney blamed Pennsylvania's Second Amendment-friendly Republican-led House and Senate in part for the spike in gun crime, claiming they \"don't care how many people get killed.\"\n\n]Perino and the rest of \"The Five\" panelists said it is also local Democratic officials like Krasner and his Los Angeles counterpart George Gascon who are creating a political issue for national Democrats.\n\nHost Jesse Watters, a Philadelphia native, ripped both Krasner and Biden, saying that the district attorney should \"feel the pain, not spin the pain\" of southeastern Pennsylvanians, while the president separately appears \"out of touch\" with the fears of Americans living with a national crime spike.\n\n\"The [people] feel like the country is going down, down, down and that\u2019s where he looks like he is out of touch,\" Watters said. \"If I was a Democrat running for the reelection, you know what I would do? I would retire and become a lobbyist.\"\n\n\"[W]hy would I want to sit around and dial for dollars if I\u2019m going to get smoked in the midterms? \u2026 The donors don\u2019t want to give me any money, they know I\u2019m getting smoked, so what am I going to run for reelection [for]?\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that few Democrats outside of safe districts will want the president to campaign with them, which is a blow to the typical support felt by lawmakers aligned with a president's party.\n\nWatters said that if he were a Democratic lawmaker, he might instead invite Michelle Obama or Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg as a proxy for Biden.\n\n\"[Biden] is not Barack [Obama] \u2026 he is not Donald Trump \u2013 they were historic and both had huge bases and both of their parties got crushed in the midterms,\" he argued. \"What does Joe have going for him?\"",

These are people who tell you one thing, then follow up with a \"but,\" that contradicts what they just said. They start with a panic line, but then condition it with: \"but we still don\u2019t know.\" That way they get to scare your ass, then cover their own. So let's follow the \"buts\", and see where these asses take us.\n\nAccording to Axios, the website, not my Pilates instructor, the country is bracing for a terrifying wave of omicron. But, the new variant seems to be much less severe. But Boris Johnson says there is a tidal wave coming. But one of his experts adds: only ten people have been admitted to the hospital with it. But we should have known: never believe anything a person says who doesn't own a comb.\n\nHOW IS COVID GOING TO END?\n\nStill, you must get a third dose to bring the level of protection back up! Because the variant seems to spread among people who've received two jabs. But it's not a big deal for those who get it. Still, you gotta mask up and get another dose.\n\nBut this is nothing like the previous strains. Compared to delta -- you barely notice it, and it\u2019s much less powerful. If Alec Baldwin were the first strain, this one is Billy... Or Danny... Or Steven.\n\nBut! -- new data from Europe \"hint\" that omicron is poised to explode in the US. True, they said the same thing about the metric system. But the variant is less likely to lead to hospitalization in adults! So this is the PG version of an R-rated film. Like when they cut out all the swearing and boobs from \"Old Yeller.\"\n\nFact is, more people are hospitalized for putting power tools in their butts, according to emergency rooms located near Home Depots. But two doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine appear to be much less effective against severe disease -- but you should still get a booster. Although - we have not seen anyone with severe disease -- but hold on, it's coming! But, so was the medical device I ordered online, and I\u2019m still waiting. I had to make my own using an attachment from an old vacuum.\n\nOMICRON IS BETTER AT EVADING VACCINES, NEW COVID-19 TRANSMISSIBILITY DATA CONFIRMS\n\nBut a senior Biden flack told Axios omicron will come fast! But it won't be as severe... But... There will be hospitalizations! But -- the analysis of South Africa data said that the risk of hospital admission was 30 percent lower than the first wave. But- a two-dose regimen was 70 percent effective against severe disease requiring hospital admission. But only 33 percent effective against omicron.\n\nSo- omicron is less severe \u2013 good. But it could still overwhelm the health care system even if a small percentage require hospital care! (s***!) The cases could reach a million a day here in America (s***!) But those cases could be asymptomatic and mild. (hooray!)\n\nBut --the growth of the cases could double quickly- - but it also appears to be already slowing down in other countries. But it's too soon to tell. But don't panic. But also, panic.\n\nBut maybe even in hospitalizations, adults are less sick than previous waves. But while vaccinations do help reduce infection -- but not transmission.\n\nOMICRON COVID-19 VARIANT NOW ACCOUNTS FOR 2.9% OF ALL CASES IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIn Denmark, 75 percent of omicron cases are among fully-vaccinated people. But you can't compare countries \u2013 except when you do. But you can't!\n\nSo omicron has high transmissibility. But it appears to be mild. But it could lead to a huge projection of cases. But we don't have nearly enough data to make any firm predictions. So the people who are telling you to do something, are the same people who are talking you out of it! These people are sending more mixed messages than a straight hairdresser. So maybe call us when you know what the f*** you're talking about!\n\nBecause to quote Axios, again-- \"there is certainly a strong possibility that a lot of Americans are about to get sick... Soon.\" Someone actually wrote that sentence. Imagine if your doctor had that mentality.\n\nSkit of doctor sending mixed signals to a patient\n\nSo what's the bottom line for all the buttheads? Omicron is like that carton of Chinese food in the back of the fridge. It could be dangerous, but we can't find anyone who died from it. But we don't have enough data. So just in case, get a booster and mask up now, whether you're vaxxed or not.\n\nDR. OZ LAMENTS POLITICIZATION OF COVID, VACCINES ON \u2018HANNITY\u2019\n\nBut I thought that's why we got vaxxed? To stop with the masks. Not anymore. Look at Joe Biden. He's gotten three shots, but he still wears a mask. He's like one giant walking butt.\n\nSo even if you're alone at your desk, or alone driving a truck, or alone having sex... Mask up! But -- not if you're a politician! Then you can go to bars, parties, galas -- and do whatever you want.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo these buttheads cover their asses by temporarily covering their mouths when a camera is near. Problem is -- how can they tell the two holes apart? You can't go by the smell of their breath.\n\nSo turns out the only thing that all these different viruses can't penetrate are the immune systems of habitual liars. But it would be nice if they could. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nThis article is adapted from Greg Gutfeld's opening monologue on the December 14, 2021 edition of \"Gutfeld!\"",

        "Text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nIf you live in Manchester, New Hampshire, first of all, congratulations, it's a really nice place. But second, we thought we'd give you an explanation for what you may have just seen. So if you live there and last month, you thought you saw Liz Cheney wandering around downtown Manchester, no, you were not hallucinating. Liz Cheney was there. And that's pretty weird if you think about it. Not a lot of people go to Manchester, New Hampshire, in November, so it probably wasn't a family vacation. Nor is it likely that Liz Cheney went up there by accident. Manchester is an eight-hour drive from her home in the D.C. suburbs, and more to the point, it's also eight hours from the CNN studios in downtown Washington that she inhabits more often than most of us go to church and much more reverently.\n\nManchester is also, not that it matters to her, more than 2,000 miles from Wyoming. That's the state that she supposedly represents in the U.S. Congress.\n\nSo the question is: What was Liz Cheney doing in Manchester, New Hampshire, and of course, there's only one conceivable answer. Liz Cheney plans to run for President of the United States.\n\nMARK MEADOWS RESPONDS TO POTENTIAL CONTEMPT CHARGES FROM JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE: \u2018FISHING EXPEDITION\u2019\n\nNow, if that sounds demented, yeah, it\u2019s because it is, but it's also real. Now, you may be wondering if Liz Cheney were to run for president, what exactly would she run on? She doesn't like Trump. OK. But what would her platform be? We know the answer to that because Liz Cheney only cares about one thing and only ever has, and that is starting pointless wars in faraway countries. The more pointless the war, the farther away, the better it is. Droning peasants makes Liz Cheney feel powerful. It's been the great cause of her life.\n\nBut you have to ask, do a lot of voters agree with her on that? Is there a massive national constituency for more Iraq invasions? We've seen the polling on that, and in a word, no. There's not a massive national constituency for Liz Cheney's foreign policy views. Just the opposite, in fact. People live outside D.C. do not support more pointless wars that do nothing for the United States or its core interests. They're not eager to send their kids to die for eastern Ukraine, and the reason they're not is they've already done it. They fought a lot of wars like this because Liz Cheney told them to and they've had enough.\n\nYet apparently, Liz Cheney is the last person who doesn't know this. She has literally no idea. She believes she has a shot at the Republican nomination for president, and she believes that fervently enough to fly to Manchester, New Hampshire, in the middle of November. So what can we conclude from this behavior? Not looking at what she says, but what she's doing? And the only answer is Liz Cheney is delusional. She's living on another planet, and on that planet with her is the Republican Party's fading leadership class. The people who stopped assessing reality are having new thoughts of any kind, right, around 2003. That's the era in which they are frozen in amber.\n\nAnd those people are sending Liz Cheney a ton of money, huge amounts of money because they wanted to run for president. Cheney has raised millions of dollars just this year, in part from political action committees run by Mitt Romney and Mitch McConnell, and, needless to say, Lindsey Graham. Apparently, all of these geniuses think that Liz Cheney has a good shot of being president.\n\nSo Liz Cheney is this cycle's Jeb Bush, who, by the way, has also given her money because of course he has. Now you should know that none of these people, and they are the very same people who feel perfectly empowered to lecture you about what's conservative and what's not, not one of these people has said a single word about Liz Cheney\u2019s performance on the House of Representatives January 6th Commission. That commission is now in the process of trying to hunt down and destroy anyone to the right of Adam Kinzinger, who himself is on the committee, and we should tell you, still bursting into tears quite a bit.\n\nLET THE PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR CAPITOL\n\nThe Jan. 6 Committee has become the American version of a Soviet show trial or overstating it. You think? Well watch it for yourself on C-SPAN? Come to your own conclusions. We'll tell you this: The Jan. 6 committee has somehow awarded itself the power to seize the personal communications of its political enemies and then make them public. The arguments really simple: Turn over your text messages or we're going to send you to jail.\n\nLet's not lie about this. The point of this exercise is not to uncover crimes. The January 6 committee hasn't found any crimes, and at this point will not find any crimes. The point is to harm and humiliate the people you disagree with politically, and that's what they're doing.\n\nSo yesterday, in case you missed it, Liz Cheney found herself with a list of text messages to and from Mark Meadows. Meadows was Donald Trump's last White House chief of staff. Now, those texts showed no evidence of any crime whatsoever. But since she had them, Liz Cheney thought they might be embarrassing to conservatives, so she read them on television. Some of those texts, it turns out, were from anchors here at Fox News, and Liz Cheney took special delight in reading those.\n\nCHENEY: According to the records, multiple Fox News hosts knew the president needed to act immediately. They texted Mr. Meadows and he has turned over those texts.\n\nNotice the faux seriousness, according to the record. Now, before we get into the details of what is in those texts, just step back for a second and consider what we just saw. We now live in a country where none of your private communications are safe from the eyes of power-drunk politicians like Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney can harness the awesome power of the national security state to seize your personal text messages and then read them into the congressional record. And guess what? There's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Citizen. We don't care.\n\n\u2018THIS IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\u2019: MARK MEADOWS RESPONDS TO JANUARY 6TH CMTE VOTE RECOMMENDING CRIMINAL CHARGES\n\nSo your texts, effectively your daily diary, now belong to Liz Cheney. And the question all of us, no matter who we voted for, have to ask ourselves is: Do we really want to live in a country like that? Well, probably we don't.\n\nPrivacy isn't just a nice thing to have, it's not an ancillary concern, privacy is morally essential. Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. You can't have liberty without privacy. And that, needless to say, is the whole point of the spectacle. To let you know that we don't have freedom anymore, and Liz Cheney is really in charge.\n\nBut what's extra amazing about what Liz Cheney just did, and this is the reason you know this is a show trial, purely political and totally disconnected from reality, much less law, is that the text message that she read yesterday were exculpatory. They didn't make her case. They undercut her case.\n\nThree Fox anchors sent messages to Mark Meadows, and none of them cheered what was happening at the Capitol on Jan. 6. In fact, they were upset by it, even in private, when they assume no one was listening. And that shouldn't surprise you. These are principled people, what they say in public is not that far from what they say over text message.\n\nIf you get a text from Brian Kilmeade, it sounds pretty much identical to Brian Kilmeade on Fox & Friends. These are not phonies. We can personally confirm that. Whether you like them or not, they're real.\n\nSo Fox anchors on TV and in private opposed the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. Fox anchors opposed the riot on Capitol Hill in January 2021. It turns out that Fox anchors opposed riots. All riots. No matter who's rioting. And we're the only news anchors in the United States of America who do this. The other channels wait to see who the rioters voted for, and then they respond accordingly, as you may have noticed.\n\nSo the texts that Liz Cheney read aloud yesterday were a tribute to the people who wrote them, but because she is a liar, Liz Cheney attempted to twist these texts into proof of some kind of conspiracy. Part of the insurrection storyline, which, by the way, is getting very old. If Jan. 6 was an insurrection, we'll believe anything, where\u2019s the evidence of that?\n\nCNN FLOATS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS FOR BIDEN IN 2024\n\nHas Liz Cheney shown that a single prominent Republican in the United States of America plotted to overthrow the government of the United States? Well, no, she hasn't. Not one. As with the prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse, Liz Cheney is proving the defendant's case inadvertently, and of course, she's lying. They all are. The entire Jan. 6 committee is lying, and they're not even lying very artfully repeatedly in just the last few days, nearly a year after it happened. The record is settled. We know the facts, Democrats have continued to claim, contrary to the facts, that many people were killed at the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nSandy Cortez, who has some kind of power in American society, wrote that \"138 were injured, almost 10 dead\" in what she called the \"terror attack on the Capitol.\" Meanwhile, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told America that the insurrection quote \"brought great trauma, injury and loss of life.\"\n\nReally great loss of life? Who are all these dead people? Can you be a lot more specific? Ayanna Pressley? AOC? Jan. 6 committee? No they can't because they're lying. Only one person was intentionally killed on January 6th. Who was that? Well, she was a Trump supporter. She was called Ashli Babbitt, and she was shot in the chest without warning by one of Liz Cheney's bodyguards. Those are the facts that they are lying about.\n\nSo how can you trust a congressional committee that tells lies this obvious? You can't. And yet the White House has endorsed all of this. Joe Biden himself claims on the basis of no evidence whatsoever that Jan. 6 was an outbreak of White supremacy.\n\nJoe Biden, October: We\u2019re confronting the stains of what remains \u2014 the deep stain on the soul of the nation: hate and white supremacy. // The violent, deadly insurrection on the Capital nine months ago was about white supremacy in my view.\n\nSo that's just ugly race politics. By the way, that was in October, when we know all the facts. There was no racial angle to January 6. What was January 6th? Well, there was destruction of property which were totally opposed to. But what motivated why were all those people there?\n\nWell, for the most part, a year later, it's very clear January 6th was essentially what it appeared to be. Thousands of ordinary American citizens, voters, people who believe in our democracy far more fervently than Liz Cheney ever has, came to Washington because they sincerely believed democracy had been thwarted. They believed the presidential election was unfair, and they have a right to believe that, and by the way, in many ways, they were correct. The presidential election was unfair, and you don't have to get into anything about voting machines to believe that.\n\nConsider the facts that we know. As Election Day approached, Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T shut down the Trump campaign's ability to send text messages and then Google, this has never even been reported, but it is widely known, Google prevented the Trump campaign from raising money over Gmail. There's no precedent for that. The Trump reelection campaign lost millions in donations. That was the whole point of it.\n\nSo the most powerful companies on planet Earth, heavily regulated by the government benefiting from government contracts, swung behind Joe Biden and tried to stop Donald Trump, the sitting president, in his tracks.\n\nIs that fair? Is that the democracy that Liz Cheney is always lecturing you about? Honestly, what's the answer? These are legitimate questions. Instead of answering them, Cheney has pushed to throw protesters in jail. OK, if someone broke the law, punish that person. That applies to BLM activists as much as it does to QAnon people. We\u2019re for enforcing the law fairly, equitably. But we also think that as you do that, if a mass of people show up angry at the Capitol, you should least pause for a second if you believe in democracy and ask \u2018what are they angry about?\u2019 Maybe we should address their concerns.\n\nBut Liz Cheney won't. And those aren't the only questions that she won't answer. Here are a few other questions she won't answer. Who is the person dressed in black who we were told dropped pipe bombs all over Capitol Hill the night before on January 5th? That person, the mad bomber, is on his cell phone. Well, that's interesting because according to criminal indictments that we have seen, the feds have used cell phone geolocation to arrest dozens of people who are present on Jan. 6th. But not this person. They haven't found this person. They haven't even identified this person. They've stopped talking about this person. Why is that? Liz Cheney?\n\nAnd while we're at it, here's another question. What exactly was the role of Ray Epps in the chaos of Jan. 6th? We ask because Ray Epps is on video on both January 5th and January 6th, encouraging people to enter the Capitol building, which is to say to break federal law. And as he says this in this video, you'll notice, people in the crowd immediately identify him as a \"Fed.\"\n\nRAY EPPS JAN. 5: We need to go into the Capitol. \u2026 I\u2019m going to put it out there, I\u2019m probably going to go to jail for it okay? Tomorrow we need to go into the Capitol! Into the Capitol!\n\nCROWD: What? No! (chant) Fed! Fed! Fed! Fed!\n\nRAY EPPS, JAN. 6: Ok folks, spread the word. As soon as the president is done speaking, we go to the Capitol. The Capitol is this direction.\n\nWell, that's amazing. Look, we're not prosecutors, but by the standards of Jan. 6, if you take a look at what people are spending a year in jail for, that looks like a crime. Ray Epps encouraged others to breach the Capitol.\n\nAnd yet, as far as we know, Ray Epps has not been prosecuted or even charged. I mean, maybe he has. Tell us if you know differently. Liz Cheney.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut if he hasn't, how come? Did reps have any contact with federal law enforcement agencies before the Capitol was stormed on Jan. 6th? Liz Cheney has called us \"unpatriotic\" for asking that question. But it's not an unpatriotic question. It's a legitimate, very straightforward question. And American citizens have a right to know the answer, but Liz Cheney won't answer it. Why?\n\nWe asked her to come on our show and explain. She refused, of course, because she's a coward. Most neocons are. But until Liz Cheney answers that basic question, there is no reason to play along with her charade. There is certainly no reason that any American citizen should even consider surrendering personal text messages to her or the Jan. 6th committee. If they're going to lie to us and hide essential information from the public, there's no reason to participate, no matter what they say.\n\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the December 14, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"",

        "Text": "The U.S. House of Representatives voted to lift the federal debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion early Wednesday and will send the bill to President Biden's desk for final approval.\n\nThe House voted 221-209 in favor of the increase after the Senate voted to avoid a U.S. default. The votes followed months of discord on Capitol Hill. The Senate vote was also along party lines, 50-49.\n\nLawmakers expect the increase, which raises the debt ceiling to roughly $31.5 trillion, to last beyond the upcoming midterm elections and into 2023. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said lawmakers had until Wednesday to raise the debt ceiling or risk a potential default on U.S. obligations.\n\nEarlier, Republicans agreed to a one-time exception to the filibuster, allowing the Democrats to pass the debt hike by a simple majority vote rather than meeting the 60-vote threshold.\n\n\"This is about paying debt accumulated by both parties, so I\u2019m pleased Republicans and Democrats came together,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said on the floor ahead of the vote.\n\nThe House is expected to sync up with the Senate in a vote on raising the debt limit that could occur as soon as Tuesday. From there, the bill will proceed to President Biden\u2019s desk for final approval.\n\nThe Senate vote followed weeks of contentious negotiations between Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Many Republicans say Democrats should raise the debt ceiling without their help, arguing any increase will facilitate increased spending on social and climate programs the country can\u2019t afford.\n\n\"Later today, every Senate Democrat is going to vote on party lines to raise our nation's debt limit by trillions of dollars,\" McConnell said ahead of the vote. \"If they jam through another reckless taxing and spending spree, this massive debt increase will just be the beginning.\"\n\nThe one-time exception to filibuster rules allowed Democrats to avoid raising the debt ceiling through the budget reconciliation process. Schumer said that process would be too risky and complicated.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nMcConnell faced some Republican pushback over the agreement, with GOP critics accusing the minority leader of caving to political pressure.\n\nFox News' Edmund DeMarche and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s job approval rating is in free fall \u2013 and it\u2019s not just Republicans saying so.\n\nA recent USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll found 59% of voters disapprove of Biden\u2019s job performance, while Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 approval rating sits at an embarrassing 28%. A stunning 46% of those surveyed believe Biden is doing a worse job as president than expected, including 16% who supported him at the ballot box last year.\n\nThe latest Harvard- Harris Poll found that voters overwhelmingly reject Biden\u2019s agenda, too, with nearly 60% of voters opposing Biden\u2019s socialist spending package. And according to CNN\u2019s latest poll, a majority of Americans say Biden isn't paying attention to the nation's most important issues.\n\nBIDEN BLAMES SOARING GAS PRICES ON BIG OIL AS HE KEEPS UP HIS WAR ON FOSSIL FUELS\n\nThese results shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. The Biden-Harris administration has failed at every opportunity.\n\nJust look at our economy. November\u2019s jobs report was the worst of the year and the lowest number of Biden\u2019s administration. The economy added back just 210,000 jobs \u2013 less than half what economists had predicted. Nearly four million Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic are still jobless.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from the Labor Department shows consumer prices skyrocketed 6.2% in October \u2013 the largest spike in more than 30 years. Rising prices are making everything more expensive: gasoline is up almost 50% since last year and used vehicles have risen by 26%. And if you hosted a holiday dinner last month, you might\u2019ve emptied your wallet: according to the Farm Bureau, Thanksgiving dinner cost families 14% more than last year.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s assurances that inflation was temporary, the latest numbers indicate that inflation is here to stay \u2013 and will likely get worse. Economists project that high inflation will last well into 2022.\n\nAs we look ahead to the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats have every reason to worry.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t just statistics. Higher prices have a tangible impact on family finances and hit lower and middle-class Americans the most. Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous economic policies punish hard-working Americans and demonstrate just how out of touch they are with average citizens.\n\nThere\u2019s also the crisis unfolding at our southern border. A stunning 164,303 illegal immigrants were caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. in October, making it the highest October number in the history of the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, more than 1.4 million illegal migrants have been apprehended crossing the border since Biden took office, while at least 400,000 have successfully snuck into the U.S. illegally in the last 12 months.\n\nThe consequences are serious. The massive influx of migrants has prompted a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed our border agents and a national security nightmare that poses a threat to our citizens. And yet, Biden has proved himself either unable or unwilling to act, while \"border czar\" Kamala Harris has consistently avoided a trip to the epicenter of the crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs if these issues weren\u2019t bad enough, consider the Biden administration\u2019s open disdain for parents alarmed by public schools\u2019 radical indoctrination of their children. In a letter to the Biden Department of Justice, the National School Boards Association complained of threats made to school board members by outraged parents and suggested the federal government investigate them as domestic terrorists. In response, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the DOJ would look into the matter and potentially prosecute parents.\n\nThe public backlash came so quickly that the NSBA apologized, but the DOJ has yet to do the same. In fact, internal emails reveal that the NSBA coordinated with the White House to give the federal government cause for investigation.\n\nAnd while Garland told lawmakers that the DOJ and FBI did not use counterterrorism measures against parents, whistleblower emails reveal that the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism and Criminal Divisions created a \"threat tag\" to track troublesome parents. Far from legitimate concerns about violence, it seems the letter was a despicable political ploy to intimidate parents into silence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nScandals and crises like these are why voters in cities and states across the country cast their ballots for Republicans earlier this month. GOP candidates swept all three of Virginia\u2019s top offices and gained the majority in the state legislature. In deep blue Seattle, voters elected a Republican city attorney for the first time in more than 30 years. And all over the Empire State, New Yorkers backed Republican candidates in races for city council, mayor and district attorney. The reason is clear. In less than a year, voters have seen enough of Joe Biden and Democrats to know their policies have failed the American people.\n\nWith Biden underwater, a red wave is coming. As we look ahead to the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats have every reason to worry.",
