                    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nDemocratic mayors are raising eyebrows with their responses to the rising crime plaguing major cities like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.\n\nThe U.S. murder rate rose 30% between 2019 and 2020, according to FBI data \u2013 the largest annual increase on record, with Chicago topping the list. At least 12 major cities, including New York, have already set historical murder records in 2021. Robberies and assaults are also on the rise, and retailers in major cities across the country are reporting an uptick in organized smash-and-grab crimes during the busy holiday shopping season.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot faced criticism last week after she responded to the recent flood of robberies in her city by blaming retailers for not better protecting their merchandise.\n\nLEFT'S PHILOSOPHY ON CRIME IS ON FULL DISPLAY IN BLUE STATES AS DEMOCRATS PROMOTE 'CHAOS': PAVLICH\n\n\"We also got to push retailers,\" she said during a Dec. 6 event. \"I'm disappointed that they are not doing more to take safety and make it a priority. For example, we still have retailers that won't institute plans like having security officers in their stores, making sure that they've got cameras that are actually operational, locking up their merchandise at night. Chaining high-end bags, these purses seem to be something that is attracting a lot of attention on these organized retail theft units.\"\n\nLightfoot's comments were blasted by retailers as misinformed.\n\nIn New York City, one of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s last acts as mayor before he hands over the reins to Mayor-elect Eric Adams is instituting a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses in the city, claiming it\u2019s his \"job\" to \"protect\" New Yorkers.\n\nThe mandate gave businesses only three weeks to comply before it goes into effect on Dec. 27, just four days before de Blasio leaves office.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday\" over the weekend, de Blasio defended the mandate and claimed the city is \"much safer\" now than it was when he took the reins eight years ago, despite the fact that murders in the city skyrocketed last year and have remained high so far in 2021.\n\n\"Eight years I\u2019ve been mayor, index crimes, major crimes in New York City down 11% over eight years. And we did it bringing police and community closer together,\" the mayor said. \"The bottom line is that there is today in New York City, a much safer city than we were eight years ago.\"\n\n\"I have confidence and the NYPD has confidence that we\u2019re going to get back to the prepandemic levels soon, and then surpass, and become even safer,\" he added. \"And the statistics show it in most of the city; there are a few places where we\u2019re struggling.\"\n\nBIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING ON CRIME TANKS AMID RISE IN SMASH-AND-GRAB ROBBERIES\n\nIn Philadelphia, where police have reported a 13% increase in homicides compared to 2020, District Attorney Larry Krasner sparked a backlash this week after he claimed the city does not have a crime problem.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have a crisis of lawlessness, we don\u2019t have a crisis of crime, we don\u2019t have a crisis of violence,\" the district attorney told reporters Monday. \"It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let this become mushy and bleed into the notion that there is some kind of big spike in crime. There isn't. There is not a big spike in crime. \u2026 There is not a big spike in violent crime. Neither one of these things is true.\"\n\nKrasner later walked back his comments but fell short of making an apology or changing his remarks.\n\n\"I know that some inarticulate things I said earlier this week have offended people. The message conveyed through media sound bites is not at all what I meant,\" Krasner said Thursday. \"Complete answers based on data aimed at solutions to gun violence will be edited down to sound bites. It\u2019s my job to make sure even those sound bites are careful. As someone whose strong support is owed in part to the fact that I don\u2019t communicate or make decisions like a career politician, it is my obligation to do better.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLos Angeles District Attorney George Gascon also recently came under fire amid a surge in violent smash-and-grab robberies in his city. Critics blamed Gascon's zero-bail policies for releasing 14 suspects who were allegedly involved in 11 smash-and-grab robberies last month hours after their arrest.\n\nGascon defended himself during a press conference last week, blasting what he described as \"fearmongering and misinformation\" regarding crime in L.A.

                    "text": "Long lines formed Monday at vaccination centers across England as people heeded the government\u2019s call for all adults to get booster shots to protect themselves against the omicron variant, as the U.K. recorded its first death of a patient infected with omicron.\n\nIn a televised announcement late Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said everyone 18 and up would be offered a third vaccine dose by Dec. 31 \u2014 less than three weeks away, and a month earlier than the previous target.\n\nJohnson said boosters would \"reinforce our wall of vaccine protection\" against an anticipated \"tidal wave of omicron.\" The British government raised the country\u2019s official coronavirus threat level on Sunday, warning that the rapid spread of omicron \"adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and health care services.\"\n\nFAUCI: AMERICANS MAY \u2018JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH\u2019 MORE COVID-19 VACCINE BOOSTER SHOTS\n\nU.K. health authorities say omicron cases are doubling every two to three days in Britain, and it will replace delta as the dominant coronavirus strain within days. But it's unclear whether the expected wave of infections will inundate the country's state-funded health care system.\n\nScientists in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, say they see signs the variant may cause less severe disease than delta but caution that it's too soon to be certain. Health authorities around the world are watching Britain closely to see what an omicron surge looks like in a country with an older, more highly vaccinated population than South Africa\u2019s.\n\nAbout 10 people are in U.K. hospitals with COVID-19 caused by omicron, and Johnson on Monday said the country's first COVID-19 death involving the variant had been confirmed.\n\n\"So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that\u2019s something we need to set on one side and just recognize the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population,\" Johnson said as he visited a vaccination center in London. \"So the best thing we can do is all get our boosters.\"\n\nThe U.K. Health Security Agency says existing vaccines appear less effective in preventing symptomatic infections in people exposed to omicron, though effectiveness appears to rise to between 70% and 75% after a third dose.\n\nMore than 80% of people age 12 and up in Britain have received two vaccine doses, and 40% of adults have had three. Giving the rest boosters by the end of the month will be a huge challenge, requiring almost 1 million vaccine shots delivered a day. Johnson acknowledged that many routine medical procedures would have to be postponed to meet the goal.\n\nSome 750 soldiers and thousands of volunteer vaccinators will help give the jabs at doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals, pharmacies and pop-up vaccination centers.\n\nWhile the online appointment booking system will not be open to under-30s until Wednesday, Johnson said any adult could show up at a walk-in center to get a booster starting Monday.\n\nLines built up at big London vaccination clinics on Monday morning. The line for shots at St. Thomas' Hospital, on the south bank of the River Thames in London, stretched across Westminster Bridge toward Parliament. At many clinics people queued patiently despite being told they faced a wait of several hours.\n\nThe government\u2019s appointment-booking website struggled to keep up with demand, and also ran out of rapid at-home virus test kits, which have been distributed free to households during the pandemic. The website where tests can be ordered said none were available Monday. Starting Wednesday, people in England must show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter nightclubs and other crowded venues.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Dec. 31 target applies to England. The other parts of the U.K. \u2014 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 are also expected to speed up their vaccination campaigns.\n\nWhile omicron is spreading around the world, Britain may be especially affected because it ordinarily has high levels of travel to South Africa. The omicron outbreak is also more visible because U.K. is also a world leader in genomic sequencing, the technique used to identify and track new variants.\n\nResearchers in the U.K. have sequenced about 13.3% of all positive cases, compared with 3.8% in the U.S., according to GISAID, which promotes rapid sharing of data on COVID-19 and the flu. While nations such as Iceland and Denmark have sequenced a greater percentage of their positive cases, the size of the U.K.\u2019s population and the scope of its outbreak mean Britain has sequenced many more cases.\n\nThis surveillance provided a key piece of the evidence that Johnson and the nation\u2019s chief medical officers used in deciding to tighten pandemic restrictions and ramp up the U.K.\u2019s vaccination program.\n\nVACCINATED PEOPLE NO LONGER HAVE TO FOLLOW LOCKDOWN RESTRICTIONS IN AUSTRIA\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government is bringing in vaccine certificates for nightclubs and reintroducing restrictions that were lifted almost six months ago. Masks must once again be worn in most indoor settings and as of Monday, people were urged to work from home if possible.\n\nMany scientists say those measures are unlikely to be enough and are calling for tougher ones. But cafes, pubs and shops in city centers fear that plummeting commuter numbers will hammer business in the usually busy pre-Christmas period.\n\nJohnson is facing a major rebellion from unhappy Conservative lawmakers when Parliament votes on the new virus restrictions Tuesday. Dozens are expected to oppose the restrictions \u2014 especially vaccine passports, which they say are unfair and economically damaging.\n\nThe measures are still highly likely to pass, with support from the opposition Labour Party.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRobert Read, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Southampton, said it was still unclear how severe cases of COVID-19 from omicron would be, but \"the evidence is that omicron probably requires much larger amounts of antibody in the blood in order to thwart the virus as much as possible.\"\n\n\"We need to get those third doses into as many adults as we possibly can, just in case this virus turns out to be a raging bull rather than a pussy cat,\" Read told radio station LBC."

The president also celebrated that over 200 million Americans are vaccinated.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi also spoke at the event and explained how Biden is the \"perfect\" president to handle the challenging times facing the country.\n\nSEN.

A stunning 46% of those surveyed believe Biden is doing a worse job as president than expected, including 16% who supported him at the ballot box last year.\n\nThe latest Harvard- Harris Poll found that voters overwhelmingly reject Biden\u2019s agenda, too, with nearly 60% of voters opposing Biden\u2019s socialist spending package. And according to CNN\u2019s latest poll, a majority of Americans say Biden isn't paying attention to the nation's most important issues.\n\nBIDEN BLAMES SOARING GAS PRICES ON BIG OIL AS HE KEEPS UP HIS WAR ON FOSSIL FUELS\n\nThese results shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. The Biden-Harris administration has failed at every opportunity.\n\nJust look at our economy. November\u2019s jobs report was the worst of the year and the lowest number of Biden\u2019s administration. The economy added back just 210,000 jobs \u2013 less than half what economists had predicted. Nearly four million Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic are still jobless.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from the Labor Department shows consumer prices skyrocketed 6.2% in October \u2013 the largest spike in more than 30 years. Rising prices are making everything more expensive: gasoline is up almost 50% since last year and used vehicles have risen by 26%. And if you hosted a holiday dinner last month, you might\u2019ve emptied your wallet: according to the Farm Bureau, Thanksgiving dinner cost families 14% more than last year.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s assurances that inflation was temporary, the latest numbers indicate that inflation is here to stay \u2013 and will likely get worse. Economists project that high inflation will last well into 2022.\n\nAs we look ahead to the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats have every reason to worry.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t just statistics. Higher prices have a tangible impact on family finances and hit lower and middle-class Americans the most. Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous economic policies punish hard-working Americans and demonstrate just how out of touch they are with average citizens.\n\nThere\u2019s also the crisis unfolding at our southern border. A stunning 164,303 illegal immigrants were caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. in October, making it the highest October number in the history of the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, more than 1.4 million illegal migrants have been apprehended crossing the border since Biden took office, while at least 400,000 have successfully snuck into the U.S. illegally in the last 12 months.\n\nThe consequences are serious. The massive influx of migrants has prompted a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed our border agents and a national security nightmare that poses a threat to our citizens. And yet, Biden has proved himself either unable or unwilling to act, while \"border czar\" Kamala Harris has consistently avoided a trip to the epicenter of the crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs if these issues weren\u2019t bad enough, consider the Biden administration\u2019s open disdain for parents alarmed by public schools\u2019 radical indoctrination of their children. In a letter to the Biden Department of Justice, the National School Boards Association complained of threats made to school board members by outraged parents and suggested the federal government investigate them as domestic terrorists. In response, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the DOJ would look into the matter and potentially prosecute parents.\n\nThe public backlash came so quickly that the NSBA apologized, but the DOJ has yet to do the same. In fact, internal emails reveal that the NSBA coordinated with the White House to give the federal government cause for investigation.\n\nAnd while Garland told lawmakers that the DOJ and FBI did not use counterterrorism measures against parents, whistleblower emails reveal that the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism and Criminal Divisions created a \"threat tag\" to track troublesome parents. Far from legitimate concerns about violence, it seems the letter was a despicable political ploy to intimidate parents into silence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nScandals and crises like these are why voters in cities and states across the country cast their ballots for Republicans earlier this month. GOP candidates swept all three of Virginia\u2019s top offices and gained the majority in the state legislature. In deep blue Seattle, voters elected a Republican city attorney for the first time in more than 30 years. And all over the Empire State, New Yorkers backed Republican candidates in races for city council, mayor and district attorney. The reason is clear. In less than a year, voters have seen enough of Joe Biden and Democrats to know their policies have failed the American people.\n\nWith Biden underwater, a red wave is coming. As we look ahead to the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats have every reason to worry."

                    "text": "Many congressional Democrats are increasingly fleeing the shadow of their party's leader, President Biden, while the United States continues to socioeconomically falter under his leadership amid anxiety over a possible 2010-like Republican wave in the quickly approaching 2022 midterms.\n\nThe panel on \"The Five\" discussed how Biden's ineffective and unpopular leadership is becoming even more of a drag on a fractured Democratic Party.\n\nOne notable Democrat, Maine Rep. Jared Golden \u2013 who holds a seat in an expansive, mostly rural district with a Cook PVI of Republican+6 \u2013 said he is not concerned with Biden's popularity because he is personally eclipsing the president by 30 points in his region.\n\nGolden was also the only House Democrat to join Republicans and vote against Biden's socioeconomic overhaul package dubbed \"Build Back Better.\" In 2018, he voted against Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in her bid to remain Speaker of the House, instead casting a vote for Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth.\n\n\"Things [are] getting pretty lonely for President Biden in his own party. Democrats are worried Biden scary poll numbers will lead to a midterm bloodbath and some are making sure to distance themselves from the commander-in-chief,\" host Dana Perino said. Perino added that people in \"vulnerable\" districts like Golden's are distancing themselves from the president.\n\nShe also pointed out that left-wing elected prosecutors in Democratic-run cities nationwide continue to propagate soft-on-crime policies.\n\n\"We saw \u2026 with \u2018Uncle Larry\u2019 Krasner in Philadelphia spending his whole press conference saying \u2018we don\u2019t have a problem, there is nothing happening here, you don\u2019t believe your own eyes, the crime is not up,'\" she said, alluding to recent remarks by the Philadelphia district attorney amid what is the highest murder rate in Pennsylvania's largest city since 1990.\n\nPhiladelphia recently surpassed 500 homicides this year under the watch of Krasner and fellow Democrat Mayor James Kenney. Last week, Kenney blamed Pennsylvania's Second Amendment-friendly Republican-led House and Senate in part for the spike in gun crime, claiming they \"don't care how many people get killed.\"\n\n]Perino and the rest of \"The Five\" panelists said it is also local Democratic officials like Krasner and his Los Angeles counterpart George Gascon who are creating a political issue for national Democrats.\n\nHost Jesse Watters, a Philadelphia native, ripped both Krasner and Biden, saying that the district attorney should \"feel the pain, not spin the pain\" of southeastern Pennsylvanians, while the president separately appears \"out of touch\" with the fears of Americans living with a national crime spike.\n\n\"The [people] feel like the country is going down, down, down and that\u2019s where he looks like he is out of touch,\" Watters said. \"If I was a Democrat running for the reelection, you know what I would do? I would retire and become a lobbyist.\"\n\n\"[W]hy would I want to sit around and dial for dollars if I\u2019m going to get smoked in the midterms? \u2026 The donors don\u2019t want to give me any money, they know I\u2019m getting smoked, so what am I going to run for reelection [for]?\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that few Democrats outside of safe districts will want the president to campaign with them, which is a blow to the typical support felt by lawmakers aligned with a president's party.\n\nWatters said that if he were a Democratic lawmaker, he might instead invite Michelle Obama or Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg as a proxy for Biden.\n\n\"[Biden] is not Barack [Obama] \u2026 he is not Donald Trump \u2013 they were historic and both had huge bases and both of their parties got crushed in the midterms,\" he argued. \"What does Joe have going for him?\""

The 39-year-old maintains his innocence, and his attorney has said he will appeal the verdict.\n\nWhile the charges carry a possible sentence of three years behind bars, legal experts have said the former \"Empire\" star is unlikely to get prison time for the low-level felonies.

But second, we thought we'd give you an explanation for what you may have just seen. So if you live there and last month, you thought you saw Liz Cheney wandering around downtown Manchester, no, you were not hallucinating. Liz Cheney was there. And that's pretty weird if you think about it. Not a lot of people go to Manchester, New Hampshire, in November, so it probably wasn't a family vacation. Nor is it likely that Liz Cheney went up there by accident. Manchester is an eight-hour drive from her home in the D.C. suburbs, and more to the point, it's also eight hours from the CNN studios in downtown Washington that she inhabits more often than most of us go to church and much more reverently.\n\nManchester is also, not that it matters to her, more than 2,000 miles from Wyoming. That's the state that she supposedly represents in the U.S. Congress.\n\nSo the question is: What was Liz Cheney doing in Manchester, New Hampshire, and of course, there's only one conceivable answer. Liz Cheney plans to run for President of the United States.\n\nMARK MEADOWS RESPONDS TO POTENTIAL CONTEMPT CHARGES FROM JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE: \u2018FISHING EXPEDITION\u2019\n\nNow, if that sounds demented, yeah, it\u2019s because it is, but it's also real. Now, you may be wondering if Liz Cheney were to run for president, what exactly would she run on? She doesn't like Trump. OK. But what would her platform be? We know the answer to that because Liz Cheney only cares about one thing and only ever has, and that is starting pointless wars in faraway countries. The more pointless the war, the farther away, the better it is. Droning peasants makes Liz Cheney feel powerful. It's been the great cause of her life.\n\nBut you have to ask, do a lot of voters agree with her on that? Is there a massive national constituency for more Iraq invasions? We've seen the polling on that, and in a word, no. There's not a massive national constituency for Liz Cheney's foreign policy views. Just the opposite, in fact. People live outside D.C. do not support more pointless wars that do nothing for the United States or its core interests. They're not eager to send their kids to die for eastern Ukraine, and the reason they're not is they've already done it. They fought a lot of wars like this because Liz Cheney told them to and they've had enough.\n\nYet apparently, Liz Cheney is the last person who doesn't know this. She has literally no idea. She believes she has a shot at the Republican nomination for president, and she believes that fervently enough to fly to Manchester, New Hampshire, in the middle of November. So what can we conclude from this behavior? Not looking at what she says, but what she's doing? And the only answer is Liz Cheney is delusional. She's living on another planet, and on that planet with her is the Republican Party's fading leadership class. The people who stopped assessing reality are having new thoughts of any kind, right, around 2003. That's the era in which they are frozen in amber.\n\nAnd those people are sending Liz Cheney a ton of money, huge amounts of money because they wanted to run for president. Cheney has raised millions of dollars just this year, in part from political action committees run by Mitt Romney and Mitch McConnell, and, needless to say, Lindsey Graham. Apparently, all of these geniuses think that Liz Cheney has a good shot of being president.\n\nSo Liz Cheney is this cycle's Jeb Bush, who, by the way, has also given her money because of course he has. Now you should know that none of these people, and they are the very same people who feel perfectly empowered to lecture you about what's conservative and what's not, not one of these people has said a single word about Liz Cheney\u2019s performance on the House of Representatives January 6th Commission. That commission is now in the process of trying to hunt down and destroy anyone to the right of Adam Kinzinger, who himself is on the committee, and we should tell you, still bursting into tears quite a bit.\n\nLET THE PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR CAPITOL\n\nThe Jan. 6 Committee has become the American version of a Soviet show trial or overstating it. You think? Well watch it for yourself on C-SPAN? Come to your own conclusions. We'll tell you this: The Jan. 6 committee has somehow awarded itself the power to seize the personal communications of its political enemies and then make them public. The arguments really simple: Turn over your text messages or we're going to send you to jail.\n\nLet's not lie about this. The point of this exercise is not to uncover crimes. The January 6 committee hasn't found any crimes, and at this point will not find any crimes. The point is to harm and humiliate the people you disagree with politically, and that's what they're doing.\n\nSo yesterday, in case you missed it, Liz Cheney found herself with a list of text messages to and from Mark Meadows. Meadows was Donald Trump's last White House chief of staff. Now, those texts showed no evidence of any crime whatsoever. But since she had them, Liz Cheney thought they might be embarrassing to conservatives, so she read them on television. Some of those texts, it turns out, were from anchors here at Fox News, and Liz Cheney took special delight in reading those.\n\nCHENEY: According to the records, multiple Fox News hosts knew the president needed to act immediately. They texted Mr. Meadows and he has turned over those texts.\n\nNotice the faux seriousness, according to the record. Now, before we get into the details of what is in those texts, just step back for a second and consider what we just saw. We now live in a country where none of your private communications are safe from the eyes of power-drunk politicians like Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney can harness the awesome power of the national security state to seize your personal text messages and then read them into the congressional record. And guess what? There's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Citizen. We don't care.\n\n\u2018THIS IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\u2019: MARK MEADOWS RESPONDS TO JANUARY 6TH CMTE VOTE RECOMMENDING CRIMINAL CHARGES\n\nSo your texts, effectively your daily diary, now belong to Liz Cheney. And the question all of us, no matter who we voted for, have to ask ourselves is: Do we really want to live in a country like that? Well, probably we don't.\n\nPrivacy isn't just a nice thing to have, it's not an ancillary concern, privacy is morally essential. Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. You can't have liberty without privacy. And that, needless to say, is the whole point of the spectacle. To let you know that we don't have freedom anymore, and Liz Cheney is really in charge.\n\nBut what's extra amazing about what Liz Cheney just did, and this is the reason you know this is a show trial, purely political and totally disconnected from reality, much less law, is that the text message that she read yesterday were exculpatory. They didn't make her case. They undercut her case.\n\nThree Fox anchors sent messages to Mark Meadows, and none of them cheered what was happening at the Capitol on Jan. 6. In fact, they were upset by it, even in private, when they assume no one was listening. And that shouldn't surprise you. These are principled people, what they say in public is not that far from what they say over text message.\n\nIf you get a text from Brian Kilmeade, it sounds pretty much identical to Brian Kilmeade on Fox & Friends. These are not phonies. We can personally confirm that. Whether you like them or not, they're real.\n\nSo Fox anchors on TV and in private opposed the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. Fox anchors opposed the riot on Capitol Hill in January 2021. It turns out that Fox anchors opposed riots. All riots. No matter who's rioting. And we're the only news anchors in the United States of America who do this. The other channels wait to see who the rioters voted for, and then they respond accordingly, as you may have noticed.\n\nSo the texts that Liz Cheney read aloud yesterday were a tribute to the people who wrote them, but because she is a liar, Liz Cheney attempted to twist these texts into proof of some kind of conspiracy. Part of the insurrection storyline, which, by the way, is getting very old. If Jan. 6 was an insurrection, we'll believe anything, where\u2019s the evidence of that?\n\nCNN FLOATS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS FOR BIDEN IN 2024\n\nHas Liz Cheney shown that a single prominent Republican in the United States of America plotted to overthrow the government of the United States? Well, no, she hasn't. Not one. As with the prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse, Liz Cheney is proving the defendant's case inadvertently, and of course, she's lying. They all are. The entire Jan. 6 committee is lying, and they're not even lying very artfully repeatedly in just the last few days, nearly a year after it happened. The record is settled. We know the facts, Democrats have continued to claim, contrary to the facts, that many people were killed at the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nSandy Cortez, who has some kind of power in American society, wrote that \"138 were injured, almost 10 dead\" in what she called the \"terror attack on the Capitol.\" Meanwhile, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told America that the insurrection quote \"brought great trauma, injury and loss of life.\"\n\nReally great loss of life? Who are all these dead people? Can you be a lot more specific? Ayanna Pressley? AOC? Jan. 6 committee? No they can't because they're lying. Only one person was intentionally killed on January 6th. Who was that? Well, she was a Trump supporter. She was called Ashli Babbitt, and she was shot in the chest without warning by one of Liz Cheney's bodyguards. Those are the facts that they are lying about.\n\nSo how can you trust a congressional committee that tells lies this obvious? You can't. And yet the White House has endorsed all of this. Joe Biden himself claims on the basis of no evidence whatsoever that Jan. 6 was an outbreak of White supremacy.\n\nJoe Biden, October: We\u2019re confronting the stains of what remains \u2014 the deep stain on the soul of the nation: hate and white supremacy. // The violent, deadly insurrection on the Capital nine months ago was about white supremacy in my view.\n\nSo that's just ugly race politics. By the way, that was in October, when we know all the facts. There was no racial angle to January 6. What was January 6th? Well, there was destruction of property which were totally opposed to. But what motivated why were all those people there?\n\nWell, for the most part, a year later, it's very clear January 6th was essentially what it appeared to be. Thousands of ordinary American citizens, voters, people who believe in our democracy far more fervently than Liz Cheney ever has, came to Washington because they sincerely believed democracy had been thwarted. They believed the presidential election was unfair, and they have a right to believe that, and by the way, in many ways, they were correct. The presidential election was unfair, and you don't have to get into anything about voting machines to believe that.\n\nConsider the facts that we know. As Election Day approached, Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T shut down the Trump campaign's ability to send text messages and then Google, this has never even been reported, but it is widely known, Google prevented the Trump campaign from raising money over Gmail. There's no precedent for that. The Trump reelection campaign lost millions in donations. That was the whole point of it.\n\nSo the most powerful companies on planet Earth, heavily regulated by the government benefiting from government contracts, swung behind Joe Biden and tried to stop Donald Trump, the sitting president, in his tracks.\n\nIs that fair? Is that the democracy that Liz Cheney is always lecturing you about? Honestly, what's the answer? These are legitimate questions. Instead of answering them, Cheney has pushed to throw protesters in jail. OK, if someone broke the law, punish that person. That applies to BLM activists as much as it does to QAnon people. We\u2019re for enforcing the law fairly, equitably. But we also think that as you do that, if a mass of people show up angry at the Capitol, you should least pause for a second if you believe in democracy and ask \u2018what are they angry about?\u2019 Maybe we should address their concerns.\n\nBut Liz Cheney won't. And those aren't the only questions that she won't answer. Here are a few other questions she won't answer. Who is the person dressed in black who we were told dropped pipe bombs all over Capitol Hill the night before on January 5th? That person, the mad bomber, is on his cell phone. Well, that's interesting because according to criminal indictments that we have seen, the feds have used cell phone geolocation to arrest dozens of people who are present on Jan. 6th. But not this person. They haven't found this person. They haven't even identified this person. They've stopped talking about this person. Why is that? Liz Cheney?\n\nAnd while we're at it, here's another question. What exactly was the role of Ray Epps in the chaos of Jan. 6th? We ask because Ray Epps is on video on both January 5th and January 6th, encouraging people to enter the Capitol building, which is to say to break federal law. And as he says this in this video, you'll notice, people in the crowd immediately identify him as a \"Fed.\"\n\nRAY EPPS JAN. 5: We need to go into the Capitol. \u2026 I\u2019m going to put it out there, I\u2019m probably going to go to jail for it okay? Tomorrow we need to go into the Capitol! Into the Capitol!\n\nCROWD: What? No! (chant) Fed! Fed! Fed! Fed!\n\nRAY EPPS, JAN. 6: Ok folks, spread the word. As soon as the president is done speaking, we go to the Capitol. The Capitol is this direction.\n\nWell, that's amazing. Look, we're not prosecutors, but by the standards of Jan. 6, if you take a look at what people are spending a year in jail for, that looks like a crime. Ray Epps encouraged others to breach the Capitol.\n\nAnd yet, as far as we know, Ray Epps has not been prosecuted or even charged. I mean, maybe he has. Tell us if you know differently. Liz Cheney.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut if he hasn't, how come? Did reps have any contact with federal law enforcement agencies before the Capitol was stormed on Jan. 6th? Liz Cheney has called us \"unpatriotic\" for asking that question. But it's not an unpatriotic question. It's a legitimate, very straightforward question. And American citizens have a right to know the answer, but Liz Cheney won't answer it. Why?\n\nWe asked her to come on our show and explain. She refused, of course, because she's a coward. Most neocons are. But until Liz Cheney answers that basic question, there is no reason to play along with her charade. There is certainly no reason that any American citizen should even consider surrendering personal text messages to her or the Jan. 6th committee. If they're going to lie to us and hide essential information from the public, there's no reason to participate, no matter what they say.\n\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the December 14, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""

Taking a break.\"\n\nTafoya, 56, a native of California, has been with NBC for about a decade after previous stints with CBS and ABC/ESPN. She is the winner of five Emmy Awards for her sports reporting.\n\nOn Nov. 3, she and the co-hosts of \"The View\" had a debate about Kaepernick around the time that Netflix released a special titled \"Colin in Black and White.\"\n\nTafoya and \"View\" co-host Sunny Hostin clashed on the show about some comments Kaepernick had made, comparing the NFL\u2019s draft and training camps to slavery.\n\n\u2018THE VIEW\u2019 GUSHES OVER HILLARY CLINTON'S WOULD-BE 2016 VICTORY SPEECH: \u2018SHE DID WIN\u2019\n\nTafoya argued that playing in the NFL was an act of free will.\n\n\"No one pressures them,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not forced to go into the NFL.\"\n\nLater, she added, \"I thought comparing it to the slave trade was a little rough. \u2026 These guys enter willingly.

After the 2016 season, Kaepernick exercised an opt-out clause in his contract with the San Francisco 49ers and became a free agent.

Police arrested him at the Bamboo Motel in Phenix City, about 9 miles from the girl\u2019s home.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, he found himself standing before an Alabama judge.\n\nDuring the court appearance, a public defender assigned to the case requested and received a gag order from Judge David Johnson, according to the Columbus-based WRBL.\n\nNow Williams is being held at the Russell County Jail without bond, officials there said.\n\nTaylor said deputies found Kamarie dead from asphyxiation in an abandoned home where Williams once lived in Phenix City.\n\n\"It did appear from the scene that there was some sexual abuse,\" he added.\n\nThe results of an official autopsy were pending, and the sheriff said investigators hoped to recover DNA evidence.\n\nRussell County Coroner Arthur Sumbry said Tuesday evening that he expected to have forensic findings available before the weekend.\n\nKamarie\u2019s mother told police she woke up around 5:50 a.m. Monday and discovered her front door was open -- and her daughter was gone, Taylor said.

The outcome of separate charges in Georgia were not immediately clear. State records show that a man with the same name currently has charges pending for alleged battery and child cruelty in connection with an incident in August 2021.\n\n\"And then we have information where he was a suspect in a 1-year-old death in Alaska, where he was a suspect but never charged because [investigators were] not able to get enough evidence in that case,\" Taylor said.\n\nHowever, he is not a registered sex offender.

Elizabeth Cheney read texts from three Fox News hosts to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows into the Congressional Record during the latest House January 6 Committee hearing, Laura Ingraham pushed back on claims and insinuations that she was being irresponsible, hypocritical or not publicly professing her true opinion of the rioting that was going on at the time.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Cheney -- previously appointed the vice-chair of the committee by its leader, Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson after most of the party-leadership-assigned Republicans were blocked from participating earlier this year \u2013 read aloud text messages between Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and Brian Kilmeade to Meadows individually on the day of the riot.\n\n\"This sent the left-wing media hacks into \u2018Spin & Defame\u2019 mode. Of course the regime media was trying to twist this message to try and tar me as a liar and hypocrite who privately sounded the alarm on January 6 but privately downplayed it,\" she said.\n\nCheney, a vocal opponent of former President Trump, said in Congress Tuesday that Ingraham and others \"knew [Donald Trump] needed to act immediately\".\n\n\"Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol this is hurting all of us \u2013 he is destroying his legacy,\" she read from Ingraham's messages. Meadows has since been pursued on contempt charges from the committee after halting cooperation most recently.\n\nIngraham said late Tuesday that the insinuated idea that she publicly egged on the rioters, ostensibly as a supporter of the purported pro-Trump cause, was a \"big lie\" being disseminated by Cheney and newspaper reporters like Aaron Blake of the Washington Post.\n\nShe pointed to a lengthy tweet from Blake from earlier in the day, saying he \"grossly mischaracterized what I said in an attempt to smear me.\"\n\n\"[Blake] was not alone.

I\u2019ve been to literally dozens of Trump events, and the criminal actions we saw today do not represent this movement.\"\n\n\"Does that sound like I was downplaying it to you,\" she asked. Ingraham then read her public tweets from January 6 as well:\n\n\"Security breach at the Capitol is disgraceful and the president needs to tell everyone to leave the building now. 2:44 P.M.

These are people who tell you one thing, then follow up with a \"but,\" that contradicts what they just said. They start with a panic line, but then condition it with: \"but we still don\u2019t know.\" That way they get to scare your ass, then cover their own. So let's follow the \"buts\", and see where these asses take us.\n\nAccording to Axios, the website, not my Pilates instructor, the country is bracing for a terrifying wave of omicron. But, the new variant seems to be much less severe. But Boris Johnson says there is a tidal wave coming. But one of his experts adds: only ten people have been admitted to the hospital with it. But we should have known: never believe anything a person says who doesn't own a comb.\n\nHOW IS COVID GOING TO END?\n\nStill, you must get a third dose to bring the level of protection back up! Because the variant seems to spread among people who've received two jabs. But it's not a big deal for those who get it. Still, you gotta mask up and get another dose.\n\nBut this is nothing like the previous strains. Compared to delta -- you barely notice it, and it\u2019s much less powerful. If Alec Baldwin were the first strain, this one is Billy... Or Danny... Or Steven.\n\nBut! -- new data from Europe \"hint\" that omicron is poised to explode in the US. True, they said the same thing about the metric system. But the variant is less likely to lead to hospitalization in adults! So this is the PG version of an R-rated film. Like when they cut out all the swearing and boobs from \"Old Yeller.\"\n\nFact is, more people are hospitalized for putting power tools in their butts, according to emergency rooms located near Home Depots. But two doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine appear to be much less effective against severe disease -- but you should still get a booster. Although - we have not seen anyone with severe disease -- but hold on, it's coming! But, so was the medical device I ordered online, and I\u2019m still waiting. I had to make my own using an attachment from an old vacuum.\n\nOMICRON IS BETTER AT EVADING VACCINES, NEW COVID-19 TRANSMISSIBILITY DATA CONFIRMS\n\nBut a senior Biden flack told Axios omicron will come fast! But it won't be as severe... But... There will be hospitalizations! But -- the analysis of South Africa data said that the risk of hospital admission was 30 percent lower than the first wave. But- a two-dose regimen was 70 percent effective against severe disease requiring hospital admission. But only 33 percent effective against omicron.\n\nSo- omicron is less severe \u2013 good. But it could still overwhelm the health care system even if a small percentage require hospital care! (s***!) The cases could reach a million a day here in America (s***!)

                    "text": "Former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum and House Intelligence Committee Member Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., floated heavily criticized new potential ways to force Americans to submit to the coronavirus vaccine injection, one of which the panel on \"The Five\" called \"despicable.\"\n\nFrum, now a writer for \"The Atlantic\" magazine, wrote a lengthy Twitter thread lamenting the lack of full compliance with vaccine recommendations and edicts, suggesting that one way to force Americans to get the jab would be to send unvaccinated patients to the back of the line if they had to go to the emergency room.\n\n\"Seems the best option is 1) Keep encouraging vaccines and boosters; 2) Impose vaccine mandates where it can be done; 3) Otherwise return to normal as fully as we can, especially the schools; and 4) Let hospitals quietly triage emergency care to serve the unvaccinated last,\" Frum wrote over the weekend.\n\n\"If, at this point, you are still unvaccinated, you are not a victim. You are a cause of the victimization of vulnerable others,\" Frum claimed.\n\nHe further described opposition to vaccines as \"dumb ass malignity\" and lamented the fact that the \"malignant minority\" is opposed to other potential mandates like \"no jab; no fly.\"\n\nThat idea came in part from Swalwell, who along with Rep. Kai Kahele, D-Hawaii, voiced support for a policy that would essentially ban American citizens from traveling by air if they chose not to get vaccinated, according to Fox Business.\n\nSwalwell pushed the idea of an air travel vaccine requirement on Twitter Sunday, writing a \"prediction\" that the country \"can go from 60% Americans vaxxed to 80% if we require vaccines to fly.\"\n\nKahele's state has also been home to one of the nation's strictest coronavirus-era entry requirements. Before the COVID vaccine, travelers from the mainland had to test negative for the coronavirus from a Honolulu-approved test vendor and then file documentation with the state's \"Safe Travels\" website.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., furthermore recently introduced a bill co-sponsored by Swalwell, Kahele and Hawaii's other House member, Ed Case, that would \"direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that any individual traveling on a flight that departs from or arrives to an airport inside the United States\u2026 is fully vaccinated against COVID\u201319.\"\n\nOn \"The Five\", host Jesse Watters called the ideas from Swalwell and Frum \"COVID hysteria back in full force.\"\n\n\"Liberals are renewing their push for a forever pandemic,\" he said.\n\n\"David Frum from \u2018The Atlantic\u2019 had a truly despicable idea suggesting treating unvaxxed patients last at hospitals.\"\n\nHost Dana Perino further wondered aloud whether Frum and the proponents of the vax-to-fly policy drafted by Torres were paying any attention to the stark message the American people sent them with the recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey where Republicans overperformed in part because of voters' frustration with both socioeconomic lockdown policies and leftist school curricula.\n\n\"And you had this other problem where you have fancy people who can go to a big party and mingle around without a mask, [while] anyone who works there had to wear a mask,\" she added.\n\n\"There\u2019s a huge disconnect \u2026 The inequality of this shaming is really big. We\u2019ve never figured out a way to address natural immunity. We never figured out a way to talk about the fact that we do have [other] treatments.\n\n\"For an example, David Frum's idea, like as you said, is despicable, and is also ridiculous because there are easy ways to treat it now with amazing advancements in science.\"\n\nPerino concluded by saying that making the liberal firebrand Swalwell \"the face of telling Americans that you aren't allowed to travel\" would be the best way to start a nationwide popular backlash.\n\nIn other reporting on Fox News, host Tucker Carlson has pointed out Swalwell's penchant for coronavirus-era travel, including to Qatar, where he was famously pictured shirtless and looking exuberant atop a camel while its handler stood in the photo's foreground.\n\n\"The Five\" host Greg Gutfeld remarked that the controversial emergency room policy proposal is proof that Frum is \"a broken man\" and that the Bush-era politico has been \"suffering from irrelevance\" as of late.\n\n\"He is pretty much just lashing out,\" he said. \"Everybody knows people who haven't been vaccinated for legitimate reasons and there are therapeutics that can help and so on. So he\u2019s doing this because he is a sad, sad, loser.\"\n\nFox Business' Houston Keene contributed to this report."

He was the longest-serving senator in Nevada history when he retired in 2017. He also served from 1983 to 1987 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement, the native of Searchlight, Nevada, recalled his first airplane ride at the airport in 1958 and his more than three decades of trips home from Washington.\n\n\"I worked hard during my years in Congress to help build and grow the airport, and it is a source of tremendous pride to me,\" Reid said in the statement. \"It is the indispensable ingredient to Las Vegas\u2019 success; it\u2019s the gateway through which millions come from every corner of the world to see our city, which is like no other place on earth.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS EVENTS, VENUES BEGIN REQUIRING COVID-19 VACCINATION PROOF\n\nReid pushed for development of the Terminal 3 international arrivals annex, which opened in June 2012 and served as the site of Tuesday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nThe airport handled 51.5 million passengers in pre-coronavirus 2019, including some 3.8 million from cities including London, Amsterdam, Mexico City, Frankfurt, Germany, and Tel Aviv, Israel. The airport ranks among the 10 busiest in the U.S.\n\nThe airport was founded as Alamo Field in 1942. It was named 73 years ago for then-U.S. senator from Nevada Pat McCarran, a Democrat whose legacy is clouded by accounts of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism during his time in public office. McCarran also owned the airport, and he lobbied for commercial aviation, federal public works and benefits for his home state. He died in 1954.\n\nClark County now owns the airport and elected local lawmakers voted unanimously in February to make the name change after years of advocacy led by Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom.\n\n\"Sen. McCarran, in retrospect, was not a perfect human being and did and said a lot of bad things,\" Segerblom said Tuesday. \"We are not the Nevada Senator McCarran worked at or lived in. We are a very multicultural, diverse, a multiracial, a multi-ethnic city.\"\n\nOfficials have said the expected $7.2 million cost to rename the airport is being privately raised, with some $3 million still to come to be used for changing signs and markers from curb to gate at the airport, and for vehicle decals, uniforms and administrative costs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe airport\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration designator remains LAS, but the FAA began listing the Reid name on aviation charts in June.\n\nAirport spokesman Joe Rajchel said passengers will notice changes on airport social media channels including Facebook and Twitter, although its Twitter handle remains @LASairport."

This slice is from a much longer essay by the Doocys that appears in a section of the book aptly called the \"Joy of Family.\"\n\nRead this holiday excerpt by Steve Doocy and Peter Doocy\n\nSteve Doocy in All American Christmas: Sometime in 1987, when my wife, Kathy, was pregnant with our son, Peter, I saw a story that set me on a path I hadn't considered taking before.\n\nThis gentleman had been snapping a photo of his son on the young man's birthday for twenty-five consecutive years.\n\nMore than that, he took the photo with his son standing in the exact same spot every time. It was a time-lapse family, every shot taken one year later.\n\nI know that has been done by millions of parents by now, but this was the first I'd heard of it. I didn't want to copy his idea exactly, but I liked the concept of having that year-to-year record we could all review at some point in the future.\n\nI decided then and there that I wanted to video our children coming down the stairs on Christmas morning to get to the tree and the presents beneath it.\n\nSo, the first Christmas that Peter could walk on his own, we instituted what has become an ongoing tradition.\n\nMary, our second child, joined us in time for the second year of the photo opportunity and was carried downstairs by my wife, Kathy. And then our youngest child, Sally, joined her brother and her sister for the mad dash down the stairs, a cherished family tradition that we kept alive every single year after that, right up until the 2020 pandemic, which kept Peter from joining us at the home he'd grown up in.\n\nSome of you reading this may have seen a collection of clips that I stitched together into a video that we aired on \"Fox and Friends\" about fifteen years ago.\n\nQuite a few times, Kathy and I have been out at a promotional event for one of my books or some other function. Inevitably, someone will approach us and say, \"Hey! I watched your kids grow up running down the stairs.\"\n\n\"He was like a cameraman at a NASCAR race filming us as we dashed past him, banked the turn through the dining room, and then the straightaway through the kitchen to get to the tree.\" \u2014 Peter Doocy about his dad\n\nI'm glad that treasured family moment, and such an iconic experience in many kids' lives, has been one we can share. After all, that's what Christmas is all about: giving.\n\nRight, Peter?\n\nPeter Doocy in All American Christmas: That's true, Dad.\n\nFrom my perspective, though, as kids we might not have been as charitable and loving as the season calls for.\n\nAt the top of the steps, we did engage in some jostling to get to the head of the line and be the first one down the stairs and to that tree. It was almost as if we were basketball players trying to box out our opponent and get the rebound!\n\nSteve Doocy: Peter's right; the competition was fierce. It took Mary twenty-eight years to finally get to the tree first, and she celebrated with a little end-zone dance.\n\nPeter dominated the competition for most of those years.\n\nBEST CHRISTMAS GIFT EVER: AMAZING REVEALS FROM FOX NEWS PERSONALITIES\n\nPeter Doocy: Dad should know all about it. As the cameraman/director, he wanted to be sure he got as much of the moment on tape as possible.\n\nHe was like a cameraman at a NASCAR race filming us as we dashed past him, banked the turn through the dining room, and then the straightaway through the kitchen to get to the tree \u2026\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSteve Doocy: Being together is the magic of Christmas.\n\nExcerpted from All American Christmas by Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy.

                    "text": "A group of prominent Democratic lawmakers are calling on the Biden administration to make it easier for military personnel to have their federal student loans forgiven.\n\nIn a Nov. 17 letter addressed to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, 14 senators urged the Department of Education to offer student debt relief for military service members under the recently-overhauled Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). The letter is signed by progressives like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nAbout 200,000 military members owe more than $2.9 billion in student loan debt, the letter stated. Yet 94% of service members and civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DOD) who previously applied for the PSLF program have been denied, it continued, citing a report from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about student loan forgiveness for military service members and consider the alternative debt repayment options like refinancing. You can compare student loan refinance rates on Credible for free without impacting your credit score.\n\nSTUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN NONPROFIT SECTOR WILL FACE DIFFICULTY WHEN PAYMENTS RESUME\n\nRecent changes to military student loan repayment programs\n\nThe Education Department announced in October an overhaul to the PSLF program that made it easier for 550,000 federal student loan borrowers to qualify for student debt forgiveness, as long as they enroll in a Direct Consolidation Loan by Oct. 31, 2022.\n\nUnder the PSLF program, eligible public servants \u2014 including military personnel \u2014 can apply to have the remainder of their federal Direct loan debt discharged after making 120 consecutive qualifying payments. The temporary PSLF waiver, which is in effect for a limited time as a result of the COVID-19 national emergency, made it so any prior payment made by eligible PSLF borrowers would count as a qualifying payment.\n\nAdditionally, the Department indicated that it would \"develop and implement a process to address periods of student loan deferments and forbearance for active-duty service members,\" making it easier for military members to qualify for debt forgiveness.\n\nHowever, specific details regarding updates to military student loan forgiveness have been scant. In their letter to Education Secretary Cardona, the senators asked the Department to \"move quickly\" in implementing the planned changes for military service members.\n\nThe lawmakers are also calling for the Biden administration to \"eliminate the need for service members with federal student loans [to] take additional steps in order to receive the benefits\" of PSLF, as long as they've fulfilled their years of service.\n\nThe Education Department hasn't announced any further updates to the PSLF program since the senators wrote the letter last month. Student loan borrowers who need relief now may be able to reduce their monthly payments by refinancing to a private loan at a lower rate. Keep in mind that refinancing your federal loans into a private loan would make you ineligible for select student loan forgiveness programs like PSLF.\n\nStudent loan refinance rates are near historic lows, according to data from Credible. You can browse interest rates from private student loan lenders in the table below.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOUR STUDENT LOAN SERVICER IS SHUTTING DOWN\n\nActive-duty military personnel automatically receive student loan relief\n\nIn August, the Education Department announced that it would automatically waive the interest on federal student loans for more than 47,000 current and former active-duty military service members. Previously, eligible military personnel had to apply for the interest waiver.\n\n\"Brave men and women in uniform serving our country can now focus on doing their jobs and coming home safely, not filling out more paperwork to access their hard-earned benefits,\" Richard Cordray of the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) said.\n\nThe interest waiver applies to certain federal student loans disbursed on or after Oct. 1, 2008, that are held by military personnel who were deployed to hostile areas of imminent danger. Because of these restrictions, not all veterans and active-duty service members will qualify for this benefit.\n\nIf you don't meet the eligibility requirements for the student loan interest waiver or the PSLF program, consider alternative student loan repayment plans such as refinancing. You may be able to pay off your college debt faster, lower your monthly payments and save money on interest.\n\nVisit Credible to compare refi offers, and use a student loan refinancing calculator to decide if this option is right for you.\n\nBIDEN CANCELS $5.8B IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR BORROWERS WITH A TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY\n\nHave a finance-related question, but don't know who to ask?

Fortunately, American ingenuity delivered safe and effective vaccines in record-breaking time, and innovation continues on promising new treatments for those infected. Even so, the American people are coming to the realization that the answer is to adapt, overcome, and move forward with their lives, not simply to shut down and wait.\n\nUnfortunately, what was originally an emergency step at the beginning of the pandemic\u2014shuttering the U.S. Capitol and surrounding buildings\u2014has slowly morphed into the new normal in Washington. The ultimate symbol of democracy in our country and around the world remains the Capitol\u2019s dome, but today\u2014in violation of the principles that dome represents\u2014few beyond politicians, congressional staff, and well-connected lobbyists are allowed to stand below it or to visit the elected representatives who work on either side of it. Worse, Democrats in power seem content with the new rules.\n\nIt is not surprising that politicians would find comfort in an arrangement that keeps the public at arm\u2019s length. Public access to the Capitol complex is a check on the democratic process: the people\u2019s direct involvement in the legislative process helps keep lawmakers honest and accountable. The fact that some in office might find it inconvenient or annoying to deal with the American people is of no consequence.\n\n\n\nWith the Capitol complex closed, the number of direct meetings between citizens and their elected representatives is dramatically reduced. Much of the important work of congressional committees is off limits to the public. Public tours of the national landmark are prohibited, and the doors to the U.S Capitol Visitors Center (CVC)\u2014which cost taxpayers $600 million to build\u2014remain locked.\n\nSimilarly, the corresponding limitation on visitors to the Senate and House office buildings is equally frustrating. Some congressional offices, including my own, have been staffed in person throughout 2021. Since April, my office has facilitated in person meetings with constituents and stakeholders, despite the unnecessary requirement that staff meet our visitors at a security check point and escort them through the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\nProviding constituents an opportunity to be heard by their elected representatives and staff is a proud Capitol Hill tradition. As I\u2019m sure many of my colleagues would agree, hearing directly from a constituent about how a federal law, policy, or program affects their life is among the most valuable ways Members of Congress understand public sentiment. Our guests\u2014who express sincere gratitude for the opportunity to be heard in person. That is a worrisome development; we should never allow the norm in Congress to be that American citizens should feel \"grateful\" for a meeting with a Member of Congress or congressional staff. In many respects, our job is to listen, and, in fact, we should be grateful to public for the opportunity to serve in Washington.\n\nAnd, after months of awaiting word that public tours would resume, it was recently announced that Senate staff may lead just two tours per week, with only six people per tour, through an extremely abbreviated visit to the Capitol. It is my understanding that there is still no concrete plan in development to broadly allow visitors in the entirety of the publicly accessible areas of U.S Capitol, to reopen the CVC, or to permit regular and easy access to the Senate office buildings. That must change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile it may be reasonable to make certain accommodations to ensure the health and safety of members, staff, and visitors, current conditions no longer justify a blanket prohibition on the public\u2019s access to Capitol Hill. Right now, Democrats run the House and Senate, and their leadership should take all necessary steps to restore public access to the Capitol and surrounding office buildings in a manner consistent with pre-March 2020 security protocols.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI am confident that virtual meetings with citizens who wish to communicate through those channels will continue. Additionally, individual member offices can determine if and how they receive constituents\u2014and then be judged accordingly by their voters. But, given current health conditions and the likelihood that COVID will, in some form, persist for many years, congressional leadership should no longer allow Congress to hide behind an overly broad exclusion of the American people from in-person civic participation on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to find a way to let the people back in."

                    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nFor well nigh two years now Democrats across America have urged strict restrictions and obedience from the nation in all matters regarding COVID. Turn your life upside down, send your kid to school in masks to eat lunch in chilly weather on the ground of the yard, and by all means get your two, or three, or however many vaccination jabs. If it can save just one life, and all that. But when it comes to crime, these same lefties have more risk tolerance than a drunk 22-year-old at a Vegas craps table. What gives?\n\nThink about this statement the progressive Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm made when he was elected in 2007 regarding his lax approach to crime, \"Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into treatment program, who\u2019s going to go out and kill somebody? You bet. Guaranteed. It\u2019s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.\"\n\nAMERICANS WORRY ABOUT SOARING CRIME RATE -- DEMOCRATS RESPOND BY STANDING UP FOR CRIMINALS\n\nWe saw the fruits of this wrongheaded approach last month when Darrell Brooks Jr., exited the turnstile of Milwaukee County\u2019s criminal justice system, despite a rap sheet longer than a CVS receipt, to allegedly murder 6 people at a Christmas parade.\n\nIn New York, a grad student lost his life to a knife attack to another career criminal roaming Manhattan who should have been behind bars.\n\nIt's happening all over the country. And it is making the law-abiding people of America second class citizens in their own cities. While Democrats moan and wail about the danger of the unvaccinated, even though we know that the vaccinated are perfectly capable of spreading COVID, our criminal class is coddled at every turn.\n\nCHICAGO FATHER VIOLENTLY ATTACKED, KILLED WHILE HANGING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS OUTSIDE HOME, FAMILY SAYS\n\nDemocrats and their media allies might argue that COVID and the hundreds of thousands of deaths it has wrought is on a different scale than our crime crisis. But that is little consolation to the families of those who died preventable deaths owing to woke prosecutors. And besides that, crime in our cities is a paralyzing force that rains negative outcomes down on millions of Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSo what explains this disparity in risk tolerance? Put simply, COVID has no claim to oppressed status, except maybe in regard to what we are allowed to call it. Sacrificing Americans to COVID serves no social justice purpose, but sacrificing Americans to crime does.\n\nEven regarding COVID we see this dynamic at work. Everyone, including American citizens who enter the country legally must run a gauntlet of COVID restrictions, but those who break into the country through our spaghetti strainer of a Southern border may traipse in free of any protocols at all. The migrants, you see, are oppressed, and exemptions must be made for them.\n\nDemocrats lack the serenity to accept what they cannot change about COVID, they lack the courage to change what they can about crime and are severely lacking in the wisdom to see the difference.\n\nThe irony here is that despite our best efforts for 2 years we have no idea how to effectively stop the spread of COVID, the Florida model, the New York Model, the Sweden model, the Australia model, all have pros and cons. But in regard to crime, we know exactly how to fight it. In cities across America, led by New York, the police tactics of the 1990s chopped crime at the knees, and yet we have abandoned those police and prosecutorial practices.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats lack the serenity to accept what they cannot change about COVID, they lack the courage to change what they can about crime, and are severely lacking in the wisdom to see the difference.\n\nThis is not a mystery that progressive prosecutors have to solve, we know how to fight crime in our major cities, it's time we get back to doing it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS"

                    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nTwo western, Democrat-run states are taking exact opposite approaches to the new Covid-19 variants. In California, a new statewide mask mandate takes effect tomorrow. In Colorado, the Governor announced this week that the Covid emergency is over.\n\nWhich decision is correct?\n\nDR. NICOLE SAPHIER: HOW IS COVID GOING TO END?\n\nCalifornia\u2019s mandate comes not come from Governor Gavin Newsom. It comes from Dr. Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n, the Director of the California Department of Public Health. This is an unelected position given power to issue such edicts due to the state of emergency declared by the governor almost two years ago. California has been in an ongoing state of emergency since, despite vaccines available to all and dramatic drops in infection rates.\n\nBefore becoming director earlier this year, Dr. Aragon was the health officer for the City and County of San Francisco. Before that he was in charge of public health at University of California, Berkeley, where he is still an adjunct professor. He has degrees from Berkeley and Harvard.\n\nAccording to his biography, he became the state director earlier this year with a mission of \"striving to embody and promote the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion and humility, he works through collaborative partnerships to mobilize communities and institutions to transform policies and systems towards a culture of equity, antiracism, healing and health for all people and our planet.\" Yes, he worked \"equity\" twice into the same sentence.\n\nThe new edict begins by noting that the \"vaccines remain effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\" Nonetheless, it goes on to state the Department \"is requiring masks to be worn in all indoor public settings, irrespective of vaccine status, for the next four weeks (December 15, 2021, through January 15, 2022).\"\n\nThe Order states the mandate is necessary because, \"Since Thanksgiving, the statewide seven-day average case rate has increased by 47 percent and hospitalizations have increased by 14 percent.\" But it ignores the fact that mask mandates have already long been in place in many counties in the State. The Order expands the rule to all counties.\n\nYet, it provides zero analysis of the spread of Covid in counties with the mandate versus those without it! Should this not be the most basic due diligence to conduct before issuing an order infringing on individual liberty, and which overrides decisions of local governments and impacts people from Bakersfield to Barstow and Modesto to Tahoe?\n\nCompare this to Colorado -- same virus, same human species -- where Governor Jared Polis just announced: \"The emergency is over\u2026 Frankly, people who want to be protected [have gotten vaccinated]. Those who get sick, it's almost entirely their own darn fault.\"\n\nNo new mask mandate in response to another new variant. Rather, Polis said, \"Our top goal is always to follow the science, and there was a time when there was no vaccine, and masks were all we had, and we needed to wear them. The truth is we now have highly effective vaccines that work far better than masks\u2026 You don\u2019t tell people to wear a jacket when they go out in winter and force them to [wear it]. If they get frostbite, it\u2019s their own darn fault.\"\n\nWow! Finally, a Democrat leader applying common sense and personal responsibility. He could not be more correct.\n\nAmericans should be free to take whatever measure they wish to stay healthy. Control their immunity through nutrition, exercise, and taking vitamins -- or not. Go out to restaurants or eat at home. Go to the movies or watch Netflix.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWear a mask, or two masks, or not. Get vaccinated or not. Get boosted or not.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn Colorado, thanks to the governor, Americans now are free to decide for themselves. While in California, Americans remain subject to the arbitrary edicts of a woke Berkeley professor."

While online shopping has made buying presents easier than ever before, it\u2019s also given scammers more opportunities to steal people\u2019s money.\n\nThe FBI recently issued a press release detailing ways that consumers can stay safe from seasonal shopping scams.\n\nTwo of the most common scams are non-delivery scams and non-payment scams. The first involves a transaction where a buyer sends the seller money but never receives the item. In the second situation, the seller ships out the item, but the buyer never sends the payment (or provides a fraudulent payment).\n\nVIRAL GIFT WRAPPING HACKS FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON\n\nIn both cases, people can avoid falling prey to these scams by using trustworthy sites and avoiding unrealistic discounts or offers.\n\nIn general, if a deal looks too good to be true, then it probably is.\n\nThe FBI also recommends regularly checking bank and credit card statements. This way, if a fraudulent charge shows up, it can be dealt with before more charges appear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen it comes to making purchases, credit cards offer the most protection. The FBI warns against buying anything from a seller that demands cryptocurrency or wire transfers. Those options allow scammers to quickly receive their funds, and usually in a way that\u2019s impossible to refund the victim.\n\nAlso, some scammers will ask for payment solely through gift cards. As is the case with previous payment options, it\u2019s very difficult (or impossible) to return funds to a victim through a gift card.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nMost importantly, the FBI states that everyone should secure all of their financial accounts with strong passwords. It\u2019s also important to use a different password for each account."

In February, viewers of the \"Framing Britney Spears\" documentary called out the media titan for painting Spears as the heartbreaker during her split from Timberlake.\n\n\"He has gone on television and pretty much said you broke his heart,\" Sawyer said to the then-22-year-old singer. \"You did something that caused him so much pain, so much suffering\u2026 What did you do?\"\n\nThe \"Toxic\" singer then went on the defensive against her family, claiming she's \"embarrassed\" for them for a number of reasons.\n\n\"I'm more embarrassed for my family for condoning the fact that I wasn't allowed to have cash for so long when I worked my little a-- off for them\u2026I'm embarrassed for the State of California for permitting my father to have me work as hard as he worked me all those years and never seeing a dime\u2026 I'm embarrassed for all of them and I'm sad for them because I know my value and worth now \u2026and they LOST ME !!!\" Spears continued in the deleted post. \"\n\nIn a statement to Fox News on Tuesday, Jamie Spears' attorney said, \"Mr. Spears has no idea what Ms. Spears is talking about.

Reid was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2018. Landra Reid is a cancer survivor.\n\nMGM RESORTS TO SELL MIRAGE HOTEL AND CASINO FOR $1.08 BILLION TO HARD ROCK\n\nHarry Reid served in the U.S. Senate for 30 years, including eight years as Democratic majority leader from 2007 to 2015. He was the longest-serving senator in Nevada history when he retired in 2017. He also served from 1983 to 1987 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement, the native of Searchlight, Nevada, recalled his first airplane ride at the airport in 1958 and his more than three decades of trips home from Washington.\n\n\"I worked hard during my years in Congress to help build and grow the airport, and it is a source of tremendous pride to me,\" Reid said in the statement. \"It is the indispensable ingredient to Las Vegas\u2019 success; it\u2019s the gateway through which millions come from every corner of the world to see our city, which is like no other place on earth.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS EVENTS, VENUES BEGIN REQUIRING COVID-19 VACCINATION PROOF\n\nReid pushed for development of the Terminal 3 international arrivals annex, which opened in June 2012 and served as the site of Tuesday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nThe airport handled 51.5 million passengers in pre-coronavirus 2019, including some 3.8 million from cities including London, Amsterdam, Mexico City, Frankfurt, Germany, and Tel Aviv, Israel. The airport ranks among the 10 busiest in the U.S.\n\nThe airport was founded as Alamo Field in 1942. It was named 73 years ago for then-U.S. senator from Nevada Pat McCarran, a Democrat whose legacy is clouded by accounts of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism during his time in public office. McCarran also owned the airport, and he lobbied for commercial aviation, federal public works and benefits for his home state. He died in 1954.\n\nClark County now owns the airport and elected local lawmakers voted unanimously in February to make the name change after years of advocacy led by Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom.\n\n\"Sen. McCarran, in retrospect, was not a perfect human being and did and said a lot of bad things,\" Segerblom said Tuesday. \"We are not the Nevada Senator McCarran worked at or lived in. We are a very multicultural, diverse, a multiracial, a multi-ethnic city.\"\n\nOfficials have said the expected $7.2 million cost to rename the airport is being privately raised, with some $3 million still to come to be used for changing signs and markers from curb to gate at the airport, and for vehicle decals, uniforms and administrative costs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe airport\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration designator remains LAS, but the FAA began listing the Reid name on aviation charts in June.\n\nAirport spokesman Joe Rajchel said passengers will notice changes on airport social media channels including Facebook and Twitter, although its Twitter handle remains @LASairport."

Bush speechwriter David Frum and House Intelligence Committee Member Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., floated heavily criticized new potential ways to force Americans to submit to the coronavirus vaccine injection, one of which the panel on \"The Five\" called \"despicable.\"\n\nFrum, now a writer for \"The Atlantic\" magazine, wrote a lengthy Twitter thread lamenting the lack of full compliance with vaccine recommendations and edicts, suggesting that one way to force Americans to get the jab would be to send unvaccinated patients to the back of the line if they had to go to the emergency room.\n\n\"Seems the best option is 1) Keep encouraging vaccines and boosters; 2) Impose vaccine mandates where it can be done; 3) Otherwise return to normal as fully as we can, especially the schools; and 4) Let hospitals quietly triage emergency care to serve the unvaccinated last,\" Frum wrote over the weekend.\n\n\"If, at this point, you are still unvaccinated, you are not a victim. You are a cause of the victimization of vulnerable others,\" Frum claimed.\n\nHe further described opposition to vaccines as \"dumb ass malignity\" and lamented the fact that the \"malignant minority\" is opposed to other potential mandates like \"no jab; no fly.\"\n\nThat idea came in part from Swalwell, who along with Rep. Kai Kahele, D-Hawaii, voiced support for a policy that would essentially ban American citizens from traveling by air if they chose not to get vaccinated, according to Fox Business.\n\nSwalwell pushed the idea of an air travel vaccine requirement on Twitter Sunday, writing a \"prediction\" that the country \"can go from 60% Americans vaxxed to 80% if we require vaccines to fly.\"\n\nKahele's state has also been home to one of the nation's strictest coronavirus-era entry requirements. Before the COVID vaccine, travelers from the mainland had to test negative for the coronavirus from a Honolulu-approved test vendor and then file documentation with the state's \"Safe Travels\" website.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., furthermore recently introduced a bill co-sponsored by Swalwell, Kahele and Hawaii's other House member, Ed Case, that would \"direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that any individual traveling on a flight that departs from or arrives to an airport inside the United States\u2026 is fully vaccinated against COVID\u201319.\"\n\nOn \"The Five\", host Jesse Watters called the ideas from Swalwell and Frum \"COVID hysteria back in full force.\"\n\n\"Liberals are renewing their push for a forever pandemic,\" he said.\n\n\"David Frum from \u2018The Atlantic\u2019 had a truly despicable idea suggesting treating unvaxxed patients last at hospitals.\"\n\nHost Dana Perino further wondered aloud whether Frum and the proponents of the vax-to-fly policy drafted by Torres were paying any attention to the stark message the American people sent them with the recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey where Republicans overperformed in part because of voters' frustration with both socioeconomic lockdown policies and leftist school curricula.\n\n\"And you had this other problem where you have fancy people who can go to a big party and mingle around without a mask, [while] anyone who works there had to wear a mask,\" she added.\n\n\"There\u2019s a huge disconnect \u2026 The inequality of this shaming is really big. We\u2019ve never figured out a way to address natural immunity. We never figured out a way to talk about the fact that we do have [other] treatments.\n\n\"For an example, David Frum's idea, like as you said, is despicable, and is also ridiculous because there are easy ways to treat it now with amazing advancements in science.\"\n\nPerino concluded by saying that making the liberal firebrand Swalwell \"the face of telling Americans that you aren't allowed to travel\" would be the best way to start a nationwide popular backlash.\n\nIn other reporting on Fox News, host Tucker Carlson has pointed out Swalwell's penchant for coronavirus-era travel, including to Qatar, where he was famously pictured shirtless and looking exuberant atop a camel while its handler stood in the photo's foreground.\n\n\"The Five\" host Greg Gutfeld remarked that the controversial emergency room policy proposal is proof that Frum is \"a broken man\" and that the Bush-era politico has been \"suffering from irrelevance\" as of late.\n\n\"He is pretty much just lashing out,\" he said. \"Everybody knows people who haven't been vaccinated for legitimate reasons and there are therapeutics that can help and so on.

                    "text": "After Wyoming GOP Rep. Elizabeth Cheney read texts from three Fox News hosts to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows into the Congressional Record during the latest House January 6 Committee hearing, Laura Ingraham pushed back on claims and insinuations that she was being irresponsible, hypocritical or not publicly professing her true opinion of the rioting that was going on at the time.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Cheney -- previously appointed the vice-chair of the committee by its leader, Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson after most of the party-leadership-assigned Republicans were blocked from participating earlier this year \u2013 read aloud text messages between Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and Brian Kilmeade to Meadows individually on the day of the riot.\n\n\"This sent the left-wing media hacks into \u2018Spin & Defame\u2019 mode. Of course the regime media was trying to twist this message to try and tar me as a liar and hypocrite who privately sounded the alarm on January 6 but privately downplayed it,\" she said.\n\nCheney, a vocal opponent of former President Trump, said in Congress Tuesday that Ingraham and others \"knew [Donald Trump] needed to act immediately\".\n\n\"Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol this is hurting all of us \u2013 he is destroying his legacy,\" she read from Ingraham's messages. Meadows has since been pursued on contempt charges from the committee after halting cooperation most recently.\n\nIngraham said late Tuesday that the insinuated idea that she publicly egged on the rioters, ostensibly as a supporter of the purported pro-Trump cause, was a \"big lie\" being disseminated by Cheney and newspaper reporters like Aaron Blake of the Washington Post.\n\nShe pointed to a lengthy tweet from Blake from earlier in the day, saying he \"grossly mischaracterized what I said in an attempt to smear me.\"\n\n\"[Blake] was not alone. CNN\u2019s chief propagandist Brian Stelter joined on the smearfest writing that \u2018they all knew the truth right away by the night of January 6, Ingraham was spouting conspiracy theories\u2026 based on a lie she pushed over and over again\u2019,\" she said, reading from Stelter's comments at one point.\n\nIngraham said she never supported election \"conspiracy theories\" about a stolen 2020 election as accused by Stelter.\n\nShe added that claims Stelter made about her claiming the Marxist group Antifa had infiltrated the protesters were indeed clarified by Ingraham upon further reportage as \"not substantiated.\"\n\n\"Another inconvenient fact those little men left out: Had they bothered to actually watch what I said the night of January 6 or read any of my public tweets from the afternoon of January 6, they couldn't have denied the truth.\n\nShe then replayed parts of her \"Angle\" from that evening's show:\n\n\"The Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement. Now they were likely not all Trump supporters, and there were some reports that Antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\n\n\"The point remains, if you were a Trump supporter trying to display your support for the president, today's antics at the Capitol did just the opposite.\n\n\"Those who breached the Capitol Hill security today, whoever they were, they were criminals. I\u2019ve been to literally dozens of Trump events, and the criminal actions we saw today do not represent this movement.\"\n\n\"Does that sound like I was downplaying it to you,\" she asked. Ingraham then read her public tweets from January 6 as well:\n\n\"Security breach at the Capitol is disgraceful and the president needs to tell everyone to leave the building now. 2:44 P.M. Anyone thinks this is gonna the MAGA movement is delusional. It hurts the movement, the Trump legacy and of course the country.\"\n\n\"The president should order [National Guard] to secure the Capitol immediately.\"\n\n\"When there\u2019s any big crowd there will invariably be bad actors, but blame will be laid at the feet of the White House if Capitol not cleared quickly.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Now this is all public record, kids,\" Ingraham concluded. \"The real big lie is the expansive narrative of January 6th that these clowns have made the center of the political existence. So it\u2019s time to face facts, shut down the false narrative and treat Cheney and her clique the way the American people treat them: by tuning them out.\""

BLM will call you a racist for shopping at businesses not owned by Black people, they have no problem accepting millions of dollars in donations from what they consider white supremacists.\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Coca-Cola, they lined up to give Black Lives Matter millions, and BLM happily accepted. In fact, they raised more than $90 million in 2020 \u2026.
